<p id="textruta1"> PewDiePie vs T-Series is an online competition between two YouTube channels, PewDiePie (run by Felix Kjellberg) and Indian record company T-Series (run by a company owned by Krishan Kumar), for the title of the most-subscribed channel[note 1] on the video-sharing website. T-Series has held the title of most-viewed channel since early 2017, and PewDiePie had been the most-subscribed channel since 2013. T-Series has temporarily overtaken PewDiePie on numerous occasions in 2019, and on 27 March, they became the most subscribed channel for a prolonged 5 days before PewDiePie retook the lead.[1]

YouTubers, most prominently MrBeast, have voiced their support for PewDiePie, and many of PewDiePie's fans have made efforts to gain subscribers for his channel. Other YouTubers such as CarryMinati and Jus Reign have voiced their support for T-Series.

Activism of PewDiePie supporters has extended beyond the competition itself; with hackings of websites, social media accounts, personal devices, and the creation of malware have taken place in order to tell users to subscribe to his channel. </p>
